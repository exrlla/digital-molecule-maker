# Electron web
This code is used to start 2 browser windows, each on a separate HDMI monitor.
One of the browser is set to the database address and the other to the login address.

If 2 monitors are not recognized/connected the browsers may not start as intended.

The browsers start in fullscreen mode, that way people can't close the browsers. However, it is still possible to Alt+F4 out of them
Look into disabling this functionality wherever you are running this project from.

## To run
Follow instructions on README for server + client
After server and client have started Run:
    ```npm start```
